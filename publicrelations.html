            <h1>public relations</h1>
            <h2>My public relations major has brought life to multiple PR campaigns and media kits for real world non-profits and government agencies. While my strongest aspect of each campaign are the designs, all featured writing materials as well such as Press Releases, Media Pitches, Social Media write-ups, Fact Sheets, company analysis and much more. The particular sample below is a portion of my design section from a recent PR kit for the City of Coral Gables recycling initiative. 18 students came together to create a full kit and initiative to increase recycling and the want to recycle in citizens. As part of a 4-person design team, we created a 45 page booklet which we presented to the City of Coral Gables at the end of the semester. My role in the booklet was to complete the first 5 spreads while personally maintaining and editing the master copy. Below you will see some of the spreads completed for this initiative.</h2>
